    Contents are queried for a xslpi string to use.

    If content querying fails, the xslpi rc will also fail.
    Some parts of the master http transaction needs to be copied to the synted
    one that fetches the xslpi string, but exactly what is not clear at the moment.
    The idea is, though, that the subcontent mechanism should replace the
    previous system with {bound-choice = xslpistring} pairs being encoded in
    the folder name.
