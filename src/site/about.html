      A light weight scalable http server.
    </div>
    <div>
    <div>
      Loading model.
      hty_main is invoked with a path parameter.
      this folder is taken to be the root.
      All content of the root is mapped as "servers".

      Then they are started, they can also be stopped.

      Some of these will be

      hty_http_server:
      walks all content and mounts it as "resources", dispatches http events

      hty_site_server:
      Will register a name in an actor to recv requests from siteref resources

      hty_fswatch_server:
      not sure.
      dispatch requests of some sort based on changed files.

      hty_cron_server: prolly the same

      hty_code_server: adds its folder to code path and registers its prefix.

    </div>
    <table>
    	<caption>Resource classes</caption>
    	<tr>
    		<th>Resource class</th>
    		<th>Status</th>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td><a name="static">static</a></td>
    		<td>Issues a sendfile, using mime mapping in Htx if
                    a corresponding file exists on disk</td>

    	</tr>
    	</table>
