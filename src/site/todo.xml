        <todo>
            The Fspath and Rules params should probably merge into
            a Walker param. From this you can access the Fspath and
            add rules.
            <done/>
        </todo>
        <todo>
            Perhaps the rule system needs a rethinking. Adding the rules in
            the folder tree and then the resources under it feels double.
            One could add rules in a file instead, but the double specification
            would remain. One could skip the rules and map folder names onto
            resource classes strictly. Perhaps the signature for a resource
            class ctor would be Resource:new(Walker) or Resource:new(Fspath).
            Not really, one needs to run code in the walk step, Erl doesnt do
            that in ctors. Which subfolders to walk and which subfolders to just
            keep depends on the resource class.
            So, in some way this needs to be communicated if the walker is going
            to do this. Would it be enough having functions exposed on the resource
            class module? The framework could look at all subs, and map them onto
            functions. Or, one could standardize the ctor param like above, and
            keep an init function in the resource class. This could return info on
            what subfolders to pursue.
            But, in essence, this is just pushing the rule function into the
            resource class. Perhaps the way to do it would be to keep the rules
            and resource classes separate but change how rules are found.
            If the rule to apply would be mapped from the folder name then
            this would also be faster in a situation with many rules active.
            How would the rule mapping work?
            The ext on the folder should probably select a set of modules with
            a set of prefixes, hty_ from start and Custom1_ etc, by conf.
            If any of these exists they are asked or so. Then, the rest of
            the folder name as well as the folder contents are fed to the rule.
            Hmm. This is actually like today, the Fspath param is just that.
            But the contract would change, returning a claim would not be needed
            as much as just returning the resource class module.
            Starting to feel this change does nothing.
            <done>
              hty_mounter now constructs the name of the handler module from
              the folder name. The module can then create whatever handler it
              wishes on new/1.

<todo>ref and def - replacing site and siteref
  A def_server listens for erlang messages and replies with resource trees.
  These are stored in a process per webapp. Or?

  the main actor will also listen for {site, Name, Actor} msgs
  and {site, Name} msgs. If regged, a {site,Name} call will forward the request
  to the actor owning that site.
